# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to provide two different queries that will produce results that can help us determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Using SQL we can extract the data from the employee data base to find our data and provide an analysis based on those results. 


## Results:

#### **The number of Retiring Employees by Title:**

•	The number of Retiring Employees by title gives us an insight of how many employees from each department are retiring. It gives us the data of the employees their first and last name as their employee number and job title. It shows that there is a lot of senior engineers and are looking for retirement soon.

•	The data also provides the count of how many employees are  senior engineers and senior staff , which are by far the largest employee numbers
