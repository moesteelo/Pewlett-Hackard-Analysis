# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to provide two different queries that will produce results that can help us determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Using SQL we can extract the data from the employee data base to find our data and provide an analysis based on those results. 


## Results:

#### **The number of Retiring Employees by Title:**

•	The number of Retiring Employees by title gives us an insight of how many employees from each department are retiring. It gives us the data of the employees their first and last name as their employee number and job title. It shows that there is a lot of senior engineers and are looking for retirement soon.

•	The data also provides the count of how many employees are senior engineers and senior staff , which are by far the largest employee numbers.

#### **Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program:**

•	The Mentorship program gives an insight into how many employees are eligible to be a part of this program. There are 57,668 employees who hold a senior position and another 32,730 experienced employees. 

•	This provides us a clear vision that the Mentorship Program will be a success based in the senior position and experienced employees.  

## Summary:

#### **How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?**

Based on the SQL results we can predict how many roles will need to be filled based on the “silver tsunami”.  Looking at the retirement table there are 57,668 employees who hold a senior position’s, which is the majority number of employees to fill. They might not all retire within the same time, which will allow to mentorship program to take place and train and hire new employees to fill those upcoming vacancies.

#### **Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?**

Based on the data results, I firmly believe that there are enough qualified retirement-ready employees to mentor new employees. There are also roughly 30,000 seasoned and well experienced employees who will still be employed and can provide mentorship to new employees as well.
